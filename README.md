# Frontend Interview Challenge

## Requirements

- You must use Next.js and Tailwind CSS to build the project.

- You may use any additional libraries, **but UI libraries that do not integrate with Tailwind CSS are not allowed.**

- The project should follow the same theme as the Venue theme,

  - Images are not importantâ€”you may use placeholder images.

- Product data will be provided in the assets folder.

- While this is a frontend-focused challenge, you should write backend code if necessary (e.g., for SSR/SSG or handling API requests).

## Project Description

This is a minimalistic e-commerce project built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

### Task 1: E-Commerce Website

Build an e-commerce website that includes the following pages:

- [Home page](https://venue-theme-morning.myshopify.com/)
- [Product page](https://venue-theme-morning.myshopify.com/collections/accessories/products/copy-of-drift-hat)
- [Collection page](https://venue-theme-morning.myshopify.com/collections/accessories)

### Task 2 (Optional): A/B Test Recommendation Engine

Create an A/B test recommendation engine that suggests the best recommendations for users.

- The implementation should replicate the functionality of [Weblens AI](https://weblens.ai/).

- You may implement this using a CLI tool, scripts, APIs, or any other method.
